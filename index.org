  [[https://aubreybirdwell.com][Aubrey Birdwell]] is a computer science researcher, artist, and
  fabricator in the Seattle area. He is currently working on post
  bachelor's research projects at The Evergreen State college where he
  has completed the course work for a Bachelor's of Arts and Sciences
  dual degree with emphases in computer science and mathematics. His
  course work in computer science has centered around programming
  language theory, functional programming, and algorithms. His
  coursework in mathematics included a year of discrete math, a year
  of abstract algebra, and a year of graph theory.

  During his bachelor's studies, he has been involved in multiple
  areas of research including cyber security and computer science
  education, where he designed custom visualization techniques for
  students log data, and used data science and machine learning
  methods for evaluating students data; and in software provability
  and verification where he has worked on developing semantic models
  of a [[https://sel4.systems/Foundation/Summit/2022/abstracts2022#a-Network-stack-implementation][network stack for the SEL4 kernel]]. He has coauthored a
  forthcoming paper on using machine learning with cyber security
  educational data which is in peer review presently.

  He is also actively engaged in his [[https://aubreybirdwell.com][artistic practice]] where he is
  developing new work. Research interests include designing real-time
  programming languages and tools for the live performance of
  computers and cyber-physical systems; applying machine learning and
  data science for constructing creative narratives; the history and
  intersection of algorithms and social theory.
