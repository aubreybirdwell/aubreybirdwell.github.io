  [[https://aubreybirdwell.com][Aubrey Birdwell]] is a computer science researcher, artist, and
  fabricator based in Seattle. He is currently preparing to graduate
  with a Masterâ€™s in Computer Science from Georgia Tech, with an
  expected graduation date of May 5, 2025. His focus has been AI
  (Interactive Intelligence).

  He holds a dual Bachelor of Arts and Bechelor of Science (2023),
  with concentrations in computer science and mathematics, and
  significant coursework in programming language theory, functional
  programming, machine learning, and mathematics.

  His current research leverages AI and machine learning to enhance
  cybersecurity education, specifically aiming to improve interactions
  between instructors and students within a cybersecurity education
  platform.

  In fabrication, Aubrey creates both small and large-scale works,
  from specialized electronics enclosures and industrial products to
  architectural details, often integrating technical precision with
  aesthetic design. He consults, engages in industrial design, and
  builds work for commercial clients and notable artists, including
  major tech companies, design firms, and Gary Hill. Many of the
  projects involve sensitive contexts and are approached with a high
  degree of professionalism and discretion.

  He actively develops new artworks and curatorial projects, sharing
  his explorations on his [[https://aubreybirdwell.com][artist website]].
