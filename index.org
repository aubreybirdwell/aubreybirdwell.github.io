  [[https://aubreybirdwell.com][Aubrey Birdwell]] is a computer science researcher, artist, and
  fabricator based in Seattle. He is currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s in
  Computer Science at Georgia Tech, with an expected graduation date
  of May 5, 2025.

  Aubrey holds a dual Bachelor's degree in Arts and Sciences (2023),
  with concentrations in computer science and mathematics, focusing on
  programming language theory, functional programming, machine learning,
  and mathematics.

  His current research leverages AI and machine learning to enhance
  cybersecurity education, specifically aiming to improve interactions
  between instructors and students within a cybersecurity education
  platform.

  In fabrication, Aubrey creates both small and large-scale works, from
  specialized electronics enclosures and industrial products to
  architectural details, integrating technical precision with aesthetic
  design. He consults, engages in industrial design, and builds work for
  commercial clients and notable artists, including Gary Hill.

  He actively develops new artworks and curatorial projects, sharing
  his explorations on his [[https://aubreybirdwell.com][artist website]].

  I am particularly interested in blending computer science with art
  and music, such as through live coding languages and tools for
  tele-collaboration, to explore new forms of creative
  expression. While my recent work has involved AI tools for
  education, I am keen to expand into projects that merge technical
  innovation with artistic practice, fostering creative research at
  the intersection of technology and the humanities.
