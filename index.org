  [[https://aubreybirdwell.com][Aubrey Birdwell]] is an artist and researcher whose work bridges
  computation, new media, and critical design. He explores how
  artificial intelligence, perception, and cultural systems intersect,
  drawing from both academic research and studio practice.

  He earned an M.S. in Computer Science (2025, Georgia Institute of
  Technology, Interactive Intelligence â€” AI algorithms) and dual
  B.A./B.S. degrees (2023, The Evergreen State College) with
  concentrations in computer science and mathematics. Areas of study
  include programming language theory, functional programming, machine
  learning, and formal methods.

  His recent research uses machine learning to improve interactions
  and assessment in cybersecurity education. Alongside this academic
  work, Aubrey develops new media installations and site-responsive
  sculptures, sharing his explorations on his [[https://aubreybirdwell.com][artist website]].
